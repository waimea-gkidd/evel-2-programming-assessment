# Plan for Testing the Program

The test plan lays out the actions and data I will use to test the functionality of my program.

Terminology:

- **VALID** data values are those that the program expects
- **BOUNDARY** data values are at the limits of the valid range
- **INVALID** data values are those that the program should reject

## Testing if player names work

In this test I will simply be testing to see if player names work
### Test Data To Use

I will run the code for multiple times to see if the game can process player names

### Expected Test Result

I expect that the test will be able to use the player names to a reasonable extent
###

## Testing if coins move

In this test I will simply be testing to see if player input can move a coin through grids
### Test Data To Use

I will run the code multiple times to see if the game can move a coin based on player input
### Expected Test Result

Selected coins should swap with spaces selected

## Testing if players take turns

In this test I will simply be testing to see if players take turns move by move
### Test Data To Use

I will run the code for multiple times to see if the game can process player names for separate turns

### Expected Test Result

I expect that the test will be able to display player names for both players based on who's move it is

## Testing if players can make moves

In this test I will simply be testing to see if players make moves
### Test Data To Use

I will run the code for multiple times to see if the game can process player moves

### Expected Test Result

I expect that the game will allow players to make moves
###

## Testing if players can win

In this test I will simply be testing to see if players win or not
### Test Data To Use

I will run the code for multiple times to see if the game can process a player removing the gold coin and winning 

### Expected Test Result

I expect that the game will allow players to win by removing the gold coin
