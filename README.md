## Project Description

**Old gold is a game for two players which consists of 8 coins as well as one gold with 20 places which may hold no more than one coin at a time. 
The aim is to be the one to get the gold coin out of the game. 
The coins are placed randomly between these 20 squares.
The coins can only move right to left providing there is not another coin in the way (you can not go through other coins)
You remove coins by moving them to the last square to the left; 
if a coin is already on the last square and it's your turn you can decide whether to remove it from the game or not- 
same goes for the 2nd player for removing a coin.
Although you get the choice whether or not to remover a coin if you have no other moves you must.**
