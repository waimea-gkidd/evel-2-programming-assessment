 * Notes:
 * **Old gold is a game for two players which consists of 8 coins as well as one gold with 20 places which may hold no more than one coin at a time.
 * The aim is to be the one to get the gold coin out of the game.
 * The coins are placed randomly between these 20 squares.
 * The coins can only move right to left providing there is not another coin in the way (you can not go through other coins)
 * You remove coins by moving them to the last square to the left;
 * if a coin is already on the last square, and it's your turn you can decide whether to remove it from the game or not- * same goes for the 2nd player for removing a coin.
 * Although you get the choice whether to remover a coin if you have no other moves you must.**

//    to do:
//    -set a val for data storage and create a function to store user data and update the game at the same time
//    -set controls for removing coins as well as moving them left (also add barrier so that use cannot drag coins out of cages)
//    -check for a win (if so other player loses) and display a message for results with player names
//            -if gold coin is not removed the continue game and swap to other player
//
//    1. create a data storage function. Teacher tips: use arrays/ variables most if not all of which will be global
//    write a setupGame() method that puts sensible initial values in these variables, positions on board, ask user
//    for data (player names ect)
//    2. set controls. inside of player move function controls should be displayed and available to use through the use
//    of vals/vars controls consist of removing coins and moving coins to the left.
//    3. check for a win. If gold coin is removed then game ends and return results (probably stored in data function)
//    4. if gold coin is not removed then continue game swap player and repeat.
//    5. for game loop:  for this loop add the functions display, getPlayerInput, updateGame and check for win or loss
//    - continue to next player.
//    // Loop through the list - from collections
//    for (Snack in snacks) {
//        println(Snack)
