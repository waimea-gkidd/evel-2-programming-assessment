# Planning

## Things I need to 

- make a format to shift through where the player can place their coin
- add a function to shuffle turns between players
- add a function to be able to count scores 
- collect user input which then later changes the outcome of the game
- function which makes the person who removes the gold coin win
- fun to remove coins when they are in the final square else: loser

- steps for organisation:
1. organise which vals need to be recognised as global values
2. collect input from the two users storing their moves
3. if turn is over = switch user
4. collecting input from the current player
5. repeat the above
6. check for a win/ loss = Break
