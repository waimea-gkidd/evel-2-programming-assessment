 * Notes:
 * **Old gold is a game for two players which consists of 8 coins as well as one gold with 20 places which may hold no more than one coin at a time.
 * The aim is to be the one to get the gold coin out of the game.
 * The coins are placed randomly between these 20 squares.
 * The coins can only move right to left providing there is not another coin in the way (you can not go through other coins)
 * You remove coins by moving them to the last square to the left;
 * if a coin is already on the last square, and it's your turn you can decide whether to remove it from the game or not- * same goes for the 2nd player for removing a coin.
 * Although you get the choice whether to remover a coin if you have no other moves you must.**
